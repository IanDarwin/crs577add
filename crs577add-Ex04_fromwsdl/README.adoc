== DAO

The DAO (Data Access Object) is normally a good pattern.
It separates out the data access from the rest of the application,
making maintenance easier.

The tests here, however, do not compute!

They assume that they "know" what is in the standard database,
including which records are in stock and which are not.

There should be a test database, with a different "database.properties"
file in src/test/resources, pointing to a mock JDBC driver or a
mock database with pre-loaded values.
