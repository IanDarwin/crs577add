= Ex06_jaxrs

This is a rewrite of the Ex6 solution. Changes:

- eliminates redundant ItemList class;
- database tests use a test database (wow - using real database for tests?);
- outputs in JSON or XML (XML only works on RESTEasy, not Jersey, at present);
- Mavenized project for dependency management and simpler build configuration.
