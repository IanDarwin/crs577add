= Ex06_jaxrs

This is a rewrite of the Ex6 solution. Changes:

- eliminates redundant ItemList class, just use List<Item> (N.B. Note that this
works everywhere EXCEPT with XML on Jersey, which seems deficient);
- i.e., outputs in JSON or XML (XML only works on RESTEasy, not Jersey, at present);
- database tests use a test database (wow - using real database for tests?);
- Mavenized project for dependency management and simpler build configuration;
- @Consumes, @Produces on class, not on each method.
